|14|Framework-based testing tools|have some disadvantages:<br/>1. <ins>inital setup & learning curve</ins><br/>Setting up and learning to use framework-based testing tools can be challenging. For small teams or organizations with limited resources, this may be a barrier to admission.<br/><br/>2. <ins>Maintenance costs:</ins><br/>Framework-based testing tools must be regularly maintained to keep them current with the product being tested. For teams working on several projects, this may require a sizable time commitment<br/><br/>3. <ins>Lack of flexibility:</ins><br/> Framework-based testing solutions may be rigid and challenging to modify. For teams who must modify their testing strategy to meet the unique requirements of a project, this can be an issue<br/><br/>most popular framework-based tools<br/>1. <ins>TestNG</ins><br/> TestNG is a Java-based framework that was released in 2004. It is the most popular framework-based tool, which offers a variety of features, including test configuration, data parameterization, and test grouping<br/><br/>2. <ins>Robot framework:</ins><br/><br/>3. <ins>Jest</ins><br/>Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook. It is designed to be fast, easy to use, and extensible. Jest can be used to test small, isolated units of code as well as larger applications.|
|15|AI/ML-based tools|<ins>Pros</ins><br/>1. **Incrased efficiency:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools can automate many of the manual tasks involved in testing, freeing up QA engineers to focus on more strategic and creative tasks.<br/><br/>2. **Reduced costs:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools can help to reduce the cost of testing by automating manual tasks and improving the accuracy of testing.<br/><br/>3. **Scalability:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools can be scaled to test large and complex applications.<br/><br/>4. **Flexibility:**<br/> AI/ML-based tools can be used to test a variety of applications and platforms.<br/><br/><ins>Cons</ins><br/>1. **High upfront cost:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools can be expensive to purchase and implement. This is because AI/ML-based tools require a significant amount of data to train and operate. The data can be difficult and expensive to collect.<br/><br/>2. **Data requirements:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools require a large amount of data to train and operate. This data can be difficult and expensive to collect. For example, AI/ML-based tools may require data from previous releases of the software under test, as well as data from similar applications.<br/><br/>3. **Complexity:**<br/>AI/ML-based tools can be complex to use and maintain. This can require specialized skills and training. For example, AI/ML-based tools may require the user to have knowledge of ML algorithms and statistical analysis.<br/><br/>4. **Susceptibility to bias:**<br/>If AI/ML-based systems are trained on biased data, they may be subject to bias. As an outcome, the test cases that the tools produce may not be accurate representations of the real world. An AI/ML-based tool, for example, may produce test cases that are irrelevant to other user demographics if it has been trained on data from a particular user population.
